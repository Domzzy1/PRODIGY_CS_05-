Packet Analyzer
Overview

The Packet Analyzer is a tool designed to capture and analyze network packets. This project leverages the Scapy library to sniff network traffic and display key information such as source and destination IP addresses, TCP ports, and payload data. This tool is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate network analysis techniques and the importance of network security.
Features

    Packet Sniffing: Captures live network packets.
    Detailed Analysis: Displays source and destination IP addresses, TCP source and destination ports, and raw data from the packets.
    Educational Use: Provides hands-on experience with network traffic analysis.
